# Location Tracking EPIC

## Epic Overview
Implement location tracking functionality for ThreadJournal that automatically adds location context to journal entries. The feature integrates with the existing Settings menu and provides privacy-first location services with all data stored locally on device.

## Key Design Decisions
- **Privacy-First Approach**: All location data stored locally, never transmitted to servers
- **Automatic Addition**: Location added transparently to new entries when enabled
- **City-Level Precision**: Display city/state only for privacy (not exact coordinates)
- **Settings Integration**: Location preferences integrated into existing Settings screen
- **Permission Respect**: Graceful handling when location services denied

## Design Reference
- Mock-up: `/Design/settings-configuration-mockup.html` (Location section integrated)

## Technical Architecture
- See TIP Section 7 for Location Services Implementation details
- Core Location framework for location services
- Local storage for location preferences and cached location data
- Domain-driven approach with clean separation of concerns

### location-tracking-TICKET-001: Enable location tracking in settings
**Story ID**: location-tracking-TICKET-001  
**Context/Layer**: Location / interface  
**As a** user  
**I am able to** enable location tracking in my settings  
**So that** location can be automatically added to my journal entries  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. "Add Location to Entries" toggle visible in Settings > Location section
2. Toggle default state is OFF (disabled) for new users
3. Toggling ON requests location permission if not granted
4. When enabled, shows current location as "City, State" format
5. "Show Current Location" row displays actual location when toggle is ON
6. Footer text explains privacy (local storage, not shared)
7. Settings persist between app launches
- [Arch-Lint] SwiftUI view uses ViewModel for all logic
- [Coverage] UI test for toggle and permission flow
- [Doc] Component matches Design: settings-configuration-mockup.html

**Component Reference**:
- Design: `/Design/settings-configuration-mockup.html` (Location section)

**Technical Implementation**:
- Integrate into existing `Interface/Screens/SettingsScreen.swift`
- Add location toggle and current location display
- Use `@StateObject var viewModel: SettingsViewModel` (extend existing)
- Request location permission when toggle enabled

**QA Test Criteria**:
1. Verify location toggle appears in settings
2. Test permission request when toggling ON
3. Test current location display when enabled
4. Test toggle persistence across app launches
5. Test graceful handling when permission denied
