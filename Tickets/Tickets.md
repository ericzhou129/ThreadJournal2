**Context/Layer**: Journaling / interface  
**As a** user  
**I want to** edit an existing entry's content and save changes  
**So that** I can correct mistakes or update my thoughts  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Tapping "Edit" from menu button enters edit mode for that entry
2. Entry content becomes editable TextEditor with existing text
3. TextEditor automatically sizes to fit content height (no internal scrolling)
4. Entry timestamp remains visible above the edit box
5. Save and Cancel buttons appear below the edit area, right-aligned
6. Original entry view replaced with edit UI inline
7. Other entries remain visible but dimmed (50% opacity)
8. Keyboard appears automatically when entering edit mode
9. Save button disabled if content unchanged or empty
10. After saving, entry shows with "(edited)" next to timestamp
11. Escape/swipe down cancels edit without saving
- [Arch-Lint] Edit state managed by ViewModel with original content backup
- [Coverage] Test edit/save/cancel flows with state verification
- [Doc] Component matches Design:v1.2/EditMode (revised)

**Component Reference**:
- Design:v1.2/EditMode (revised)
- Design:v1.2/ComposeArea (reuse styling)
- Reference: `/Design/edit-mode-final-design.html`

**Technical Reference**:
- UpdateEntryUseCase from TIP Section 6 (API Contracts)
- Edit entry data flow from TIP Section 7 (Data Flow)
- ViewModel edit methods from TIP Section 6

**Technical Implementation**:
- Add to ThreadDetailViewModel:
  ```swift
  @Published var editingEntry: Entry?
  @Published var editingContent: String = ""
  @Published var isEditFieldFocused = false
  
  func startEditingEntry(_ entry: Entry) {
      editingEntry = entry
      editingContent = entry.content
      isEditFieldFocused = true
  }
  
  func saveEditedEntry() async {
      // Update entry via repository
  }
  
  func cancelEditing() {
      editingEntry = nil
      editingContent = ""
      isEditFieldFocused = false
  }
  ```
- Edit mode UI structure:
  ```swift
  VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 8) {
      // 1. Timestamp remains visible
      Text(formatTimestamp(entry.timestamp))
          .font(.system(size: 11, weight: .medium))
          .foregroundColor(Color(.secondaryLabel))
      
      // 2. Edit box with blue border
      TextEditor(text: $viewModel.editedContent)
          .scrollDisabled(true)  // No internal scrolling
          .background(Color(.systemGray6))
          .overlay(RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 8)
              .stroke(Color.accentColor, lineWidth: 2))
      
      // 3. Buttons below, right-aligned
      HStack {
          Spacer()
          Button("Cancel") { viewModel.cancelEditing() }
              .font(.system(size: 16, weight: .medium))
          Button("Save") { await viewModel.saveEditedEntry() }
              .font(.system(size: 16, weight: .semibold))
      }
  }
  ```
- Use TextEditor with `.scrollDisabled(true)` for no internal scrolling
- Expand to fit content using ZStack sizing technique
- Add UpdateEntryUseCase to domain layer
- Track edit history in Entry entity (optional for v1)

**Component Reference**:
- Reuse styling from Design:v1.2/ComposeArea
- Button styling from existing Send button

**QA Test Criteria**:
1. Test edit mode replaces entry inline
2. Verify TextEditor shows full content without internal scrolling
3. Test TextEditor height adjusts when adding/removing lines
4. Verify keyboard appears automatically
5. Test Save button enables only when content changes
6. Verify Cancel restores original content
7. Test "(edited)" indicator appears after save
8. Verify other entries dim during edit
9. Test concurrent edits not allowed
10. Test edit mode survives rotation (iPad)
11. Verify edit changes persist after app restart

**Priority Score**: 5 (WSJF) - Valuable but not critical path  
**Dependencies**: TICKET-018 (Context Menu)

### TICKET-020: Delete Entry Implementation (Soft Delete)
**Story ID**: TICKET-020  
**Context/Layer**: Journaling / domain + infrastructure + interface  
**As a** user  
**I want to** delete journal entries I no longer want to see  
**So that** I can hide mistaken or unwanted entries from my journal (with ability to recover later)  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Tapping "Delete" from context menu shows confirmation dialog
2. Confirmation dialog title: "Delete Entry?"
3. Dialog message: "This entry will be removed from your journal."
4. Dialog has two buttons: "Cancel" (default) and "Delete" (destructive/red)
5. Tapping Cancel dismisses dialog without action
6. Tapping Delete marks entry as deleted (soft delete) with fade-out animation
7. Deleted entries no longer appear in thread view
8. Thread's updatedAt timestamp updates after deletion
9. If deleted entry was the last visible one, show empty state
10. Entry data remains in database with deletedAt timestamp
- [Arch-Lint] Soft delete preserves data integrity per TIP Section 2
- [Coverage] Test soft delete flow and filtering of deleted entries
- [Doc] Component matches Design:v1.2/DeleteConfirmation

**Component Reference**:
- Design:v1.2/DeleteConfirmation
- Design:v1.2/EntryContextMenu (trigger point)

**Technical Reference**:
- Updated Entry entity from TIP Section 2 with deletedAt field
- DeleteEntryUseCase protocol from TIP Section 6
- Repository soft delete method from TIP Section 6
- Data flow diagram from TIP Section 7

**Technical Implementation**:

1. **Domain Layer Updates** (per TIP Section 3):
   Create `Domain/UseCases/DeleteEntryUseCase.swift`:
   ```swift
   final class DeleteEntryUseCase {
       private let repository: ThreadRepository
       
       init(repository: ThreadRepository) {
           self.repository = repository
       }
       
       func execute(entryId: UUID) async throws {
           try await repository.softDeleteEntry(entryId: entryId)
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Infrastructure Updates** (per TIP Section 6):
   Update `Infrastructure/Persistence/CoreDataThreadRepository.swift`:
   ```swift
   func softDeleteEntry(entryId: UUID) async throws {
       let context = container.viewContext
       
       let request = CDEntry.fetchRequest()
       request.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "id == %@", entryId as CVarArg)
       
       guard let cdEntry = try context.fetch(request).first else {
           throw PersistenceError.notFound(id: entryId)
       }
       
       cdEntry.deletedAt = Date()
       
       // Update thread's updatedAt
       if let cdThread = cdEntry.thread {
           cdThread.updatedAt = Date()
       }
       
       try context.save()
   }
   
   func fetchEntries(for threadId: UUID, includeDeleted: Bool = false) async throws -> [Entry] {
       var predicates = [NSPredicate(format: "thread.id == %@", threadId as CVarArg)]
       
       if !includeDeleted {
           predicates.append(NSPredicate(format: "deletedAt == nil"))
       }
       
       request.predicate = NSCompoundPredicate(andPredicateWithSubpredicates: predicates)
       // ... rest of implementation
   }
   ```

3. **Interface Layer Updates**:
   Update ThreadDetailViewModel (following TIP Section 7 data flow):
   ```swift
   @Published var entryToDelete: Entry?
   @Published var showDeleteConfirmation = false
   @Published var isDeletingEntry = false
   
   func confirmDeleteEntry(_ entry: Entry) {
       entryToDelete = entry
       showDeleteConfirmation = true
   }
   
   func deleteEntry() async {
       guard let entry = entryToDelete else { return }
       isDeletingEntry = true
       
       do {
           try await deleteEntryUseCase.execute(entryId: entry.id)
           
           withAnimation(.easeOut(duration: 0.3)) {
               entries.removeAll { $0.id == entry.id }
           }
           
           if let thread = thread {
               self.thread = try? Thread(
                   id: thread.id,
                   title: thread.title,
                   createdAt: thread.createdAt,
                   updatedAt: Date()
               )
           }
       } catch {
           // Handle error
       }
       
       isDeletingEntry = false
       entryToDelete = nil
       showDeleteConfirmation = false
   }
   ```

**Core Data Migration** (per TIP Core Data versioning):
1. Create ThreadDataModel v1.1
2. Add deletedAt attribute to CDEntry
3. Lightweight migration will handle existing data

**QA Test Criteria**:
1. Test delete shows confirmation dialog
2. Verify Cancel dismisses without deletion
3. Test Delete removes entry from view with animation
4. Verify entry still exists in database with deletedAt set
5. Test deleted entries don't appear after app restart
6. Verify thread updatedAt updates correctly
7. Test deleting last visible entry shows empty state
8. Test repository's includeDeleted parameter works
9. Verify migration from v1.0 to v1.1 succeeds
10. Test performance with many deleted entries

**Priority Score**: 6 (WSJF) - Essential for entry management  
**Dependencies**: TICKET-018 (Context Menu), TICKET-004 (Repository), TICKET-002 (Core Data Schema)

### TICKET-021: Entry Menu Button for Entry Management
**Story ID**: TICKET-021  
**Context/Layer**: Journaling / interface  
**As a** user  
**I want to** tap a menu button on entries to access Edit and Delete actions  
**So that** I have a clear and discoverable way to manage entries  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Each entry displays a subtle three-dot menu button (â‹®) in the top-right corner
2. Menu button uses SF Symbol "ellipsis" with `.secondaryLabel` color
3. Button has 44x44pt tap target with 20x20pt icon
4. Tapping button shows native iOS context menu with two options
5. Edit option has pencil icon (SF Symbol: pencil) in default blue
6. Delete option has trash icon (SF Symbol: trash) in destructive red
7. Light haptic feedback when menu button is tapped
8. Edit action triggers same flow as TICKET-019 (edit mode)
9. Delete action triggers same confirmation as TICKET-020 (delete dialog)
10. Menu button positioned 8pt from right edge, vertically centered with timestamp
11. Button always visible but subtle (no hover states needed)
12. Menu dismisses when tapping outside or selecting an option
- [Arch-Lint] Menu state handled by native iOS, actions delegate to ViewModel
- [Coverage] UI test for menu button tap and option selection
- [Doc] Component matches Design:v1.2/EntryMenuButton and Design:v1.2/EntryContextMenu

**Component Reference**:
- Design:v1.2/EntryMenuButton (menu button on each entry)
- Design:v1.2/EntryContextMenu (menu that appears on tap)
- Design:v1.2/ThreadEntry (parent component)

**Technical Implementation**:

1. **Menu Button Design** (per Design:v1.2/EntryMenuButton):
   - Icon: SF Symbol "ellipsis" (vertical three dots)
   - Size: 20x20pt icon with 44x44pt tap target
   - Color: `.secondaryLabel` for subtle appearance
   - Position: Top-right of entry, 8pt from edge
   - Alignment: Vertically centered with timestamp line

2. **Entry Layout Update**:
   ```swift
   private func entryView(entry: Entry, isLast: Bool) -> some View {
       HStack(alignment: .top, spacing: 0) {
           // Entry content
           VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 8) {
               Text(formatTimestamp(entry.timestamp))
                   .font(.system(size: timestampSize, weight: .medium))
                   .foregroundColor(Color(.secondaryLabel))
               
               Text(entry.content)
                   .font(.system(size: contentSize))
                   .foregroundColor(Color(.label))
                   .lineSpacing(4)
                   .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .leading)
           }
           .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
           
           // Menu button
           Menu {
               Button {
                   viewModel.startEditingEntry(entry)
               } label: {
                   Label("Edit", systemImage: "pencil")
               }
               
               Button(role: .destructive) {
                   viewModel.confirmDeleteEntry(entry)
               } label: {
                   Label("Delete", systemImage: "trash")
               }
           } label: {
               Image(systemName: "ellipsis")
                   .font(.system(size: 16))
                   .foregroundColor(Color(.secondaryLabel))
                   .frame(width: 44, height: 44)
                   .contentShape(Rectangle())
           }
           .buttonStyle(PlainButtonStyle())
           .simultaneousGesture(
               TapGesture().onEnded { _ in
                   UIImpactFeedbackGenerator(style: .light).impactOccurred()
               }
           )
       }
       
       // Divider logic remains the same
   }
   ```

3. **ViewModel Integration**:
   ```swift
   // In ThreadDetailViewModel
   func startEditingEntry(_ entry: Entry) {
       editingEntry = entry
       editedContent = entry.content
       isEditFieldFocused = true
   }
   
   func confirmDeleteEntry(_ entry: Entry) {
       entryToDelete = entry
       showDeleteConfirmation = true
   }
   ```

4. **Key Implementation Notes**:
   - Use native `Menu` component for iOS 14+ compatibility
   - Button uses `.buttonStyle(PlainButtonStyle())` to prevent row highlighting
   - `.contentShape(Rectangle())` ensures full 44x44pt tap area
   - Haptic feedback via `.simultaneousGesture()` to not interfere with menu
   - Menu dismisses automatically when tapping outside (native behavior)
   - Works identically in both ScrollView and List containers

5. **Accessibility Implementation**:
   ```swift
   .accessibilityLabel("More options for entry")
   .accessibilityHint("Double tap to show edit and delete options")
   .accessibilityAddTraits(.isButton)
   ```

**QA Test Criteria**:
1. Verify menu button appears on all entries
2. Test menu button tap shows context menu
3. Verify haptic feedback on button tap
4. Test Edit option launches edit mode
5. Test Delete option shows confirmation dialog
6. Verify menu dismisses when tapping outside
7. Test menu positioning near screen edges
8. Test on various device sizes
9. Verify accessibility with VoiceOver
10. Test button remains visible during scroll
11. Verify button tap target is 44x44pt minimum
12. Test behavior when keyboard opens
13. Verify works with Dynamic Type sizes
14. Test menu button doesn't interfere with text selection
15. Verify works in both ScrollView and List

**Priority Score**: 5 (WSJF) - More discoverable than swipe gestures, essential for entry management  
**Dependencies**: TICKET-019 (Edit mode), TICKET-020 (Delete functionality)

### TICKET-022: Blue Circle Timestamp Enhancement
**Story ID**: TICKET-022  
**Context/Layer**: Journaling / interface  
**As a** user  
**I want** a subtle blue circle behind entry timestamps  
**So that** I can more easily distinguish between separate entries when reading or scanning  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Each entry timestamp displays with a light blue circular background
2. Background color: #E8F3FF (or system equivalent)
3. Border radius: 10px (rounded rectangle, not full circle)
4. Padding: 2px vertical, 10px horizontal
5. Subtle shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)
6. Timestamp text remains 11pt, color #8E8E93 (unchanged)
7. Background adapts to Dynamic Type sizing
8. Works with all timestamp formats ("Just now", "Today, 2:15 PM", "5 years ago")
9. Maintains left alignment with entry content
10. No animation or transitions - static visual enhancement
11. Supports both light and dark mode appropriately
- [Arch-Lint] Purely presentational change in Interface layer
- [Coverage] Visual regression test for timestamp appearance
- [Doc] Design mockup at Design/blue-circle-timestamp-mockup.html

**Design Reference**:
- Mockup: `/Design/blue-circle-timestamp-mockup.html`
- Component: `Design:v1.2/ThreadEntry` (timestamp portion)
- See mockup for exact visual specifications and variations

**User Need**:
- Problem: Hard to distinguish separate entries when scanning through journal
- Use case: Quickly reading through entries or looking for specific ones to edit
- Solution: Subtle visual indicator that maintains minimalist aesthetic

**QA Test Criteria**:
1. Verify timestamp background appears correctly in light mode
2. Test with various timestamp lengths
3. Verify Dynamic Type support (increase/decrease text size)
4. Check dark mode appearance (adjust colors appropriately)
5. Verify no performance impact with many entries
6. Test with edited entries that show "(edited)" suffix

**Priority Score**: 3 (WSJF) - Quality of life enhancement  
**Dependencies**: None - can be implemented independently

**Technical Implementation**:
1. **Update DesignSystem.swift**:
   - Add TimestampStyle struct with color, padding, and shadow constants
   - Reference: Technical-Implementation-Plan.md Section 6.1
   
2. **Create TimestampBackground ViewModifier**:
   ```swift
   struct TimestampBackground: ViewModifier {
       @Environment(\.colorScheme) var colorScheme
       
       func body(content: Content) -> some View {
           content
               .padding(.horizontal, 10)
               .padding(.vertical, 2)
               .background(
                   RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 10)
                       .fill(colorScheme == .dark ? Color(hex: "#1C3A52") : Color(hex: "#E8F3FF"))
                       .shadow(color: Color.black.opacity(0.08), radius: 3, x: 0, y: 1)
               )
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Update ThreadDetailViewFixed.swift**:
   - Apply modifier to timestamp Text view in entryView function
   - Ensure Dynamic Type support is maintained
   - Test with various colorScheme environments

4. **Testing Approach**:
   - Unit test: Verify modifier applies correct styling
   - UI test: Screenshot comparison for visual regression
   - Manual test: Dynamic Type scaling, dark mode

**Files to Modify**:
- `Interface/Theme/DesignSystem.swift` - Add TimestampStyle configuration
- `Interface/Views/ThreadDetailViewFixed.swift` - Apply modifier to timestamps
- `ThreadJournal2Tests/Interface/TimestampBackgroundTests.swift` - New test file

## Ideas for next phase
1. A backup capability
2. Security - need FaceID to see the page (this should be configurable in settings)
3. Add a settings page
4. The ability to tag threads entries
5. The ability to add 'snippets' to thread entries to fill out
6. The ability to have a 'all threads' view that's sorted by time
7. The ability to export more than one thread together (ie. select multiple threads to export)
8. ~~Editing thread entries, deleting entries~~ âœ… Completed in Sprint 4-5 (TICKET-018 through TICKET-021)
9. Deleting entire threads (safety confirmation to do so - ie type a word)
10. Search functionality
11. Add a setting option to shorten long entries and if a long entry is shortened there's a button to expand that in the thread
12. Pull-to-refresh on thread list
13. Undo/redo for entry edits
14. Archive threads instead of delete
15. Entry templates/prompts
