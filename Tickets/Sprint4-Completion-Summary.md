# Sprint 4 Completion Summary

## Overview
Sprint 4 focused on implementing entry management features including the ability to edit and delete journal entries. This document summarizes the implementation of TICKET-018, TICKET-019, and TICKET-020.

## Completed Tickets

### TICKET-018: Long Press Context Menu for Entries ✅
**Status**: COMPLETED (Previously implemented)
- Added context menu button (three dots) to each entry
- Menu shows Edit and Delete options with appropriate icons
- Edit option triggers edit mode (TICKET-019)
- Delete option shows confirmation dialog (TICKET-020)

### TICKET-019: Edit Entry Mode Implementation ✅
**Status**: COMPLETED

#### Backend Implementation
1. **UpdateEntryUseCase** (`Domain/UseCases/UpdateEntryUseCase.swift`)
   - Validates content is not empty
   - Fetches existing entry and updates content
   - Maintains original timestamp

2. **Repository Updates**
   - Added `fetchEntry(id: UUID) -> Entry?` to ThreadRepository protocol
   - Added `updateEntry(_ entry: Entry) -> Entry` to ThreadRepository protocol
   - Implemented both methods in CoreDataThreadRepository

3. **ViewModel Integration**
   - Added UpdateEntryUseCase to ThreadDetailViewModel
   - Implemented edit mode state management
   - Added methods: `startEditing()`, `saveEdit()`, `cancelEdit()`
   - Tracks edited content and maintains original for cancel

#### UI Implementation
1. **Edit Mode UI** (`ThreadDetailViewFixed.swift`)
   - Entry content becomes editable TextEditor when in edit mode
   - Timestamp remains visible above the edit box
   - Save and Cancel buttons appear below the edit area
   - Other entries dimmed to 50% opacity during edit
   - Keyboard appears automatically
   - Save button disabled if content unchanged or empty

2. **Visual Indicators**
   - Entries show "(edited)" indicator next to timestamp after being edited
   - Edit mode shows blue accented Save button
   - Cancel button uses secondary styling

#### Testing
- Created comprehensive unit tests for UpdateEntryUseCase
- Updated MockThreadRepository with new methods
- Fixed all test files to include new use cases in ViewModels

### TICKET-020: Delete Entry Implementation (Soft Delete) ✅
**Status**: COMPLETED

#### Backend Implementation
1. **DeleteEntryUseCase** (`Domain/UseCases/DeleteEntryUseCase.swift`)
   - Simple use case that calls repository's soft delete method
   - No validation needed (confirmation handled by UI)

2. **Core Data Updates**
   - Added `deletedAt` attribute to Entry entity in Core Data model
   - Updated `fetchEntries` to filter out soft-deleted entries (`deletedAt == nil`)
   - Entries remain in database but are hidden from UI

3. **Repository Updates**
   - Added `softDeleteEntry(entryId: UUID)` to ThreadRepository protocol
   - Implemented soft delete in CoreDataThreadRepository
   - Sets `deletedAt` timestamp and updates thread's `updatedAt`

4. **ViewModel Integration**
   - Added DeleteEntryUseCase to ThreadDetailViewModel
   - Implemented `deleteEntry()` method with confirmation handling
   - Shows alert with "Delete Entry?" title and appropriate messaging
   - Removes entry from local state after successful deletion

#### UI Implementation
1. **Delete Confirmation**
   - Standard iOS alert with title "Delete Entry?"
   - Message: "This entry will be removed from your journal."
   - Two buttons: Cancel (default) and Delete (destructive/red)
   - Entry fades out with animation after deletion

2. **Empty State**
   - If last entry deleted, shows empty state message

#### Testing
- Created unit tests for DeleteEntryUseCase
- Updated MockThreadRepository with soft delete support
- Verified Core Data model properly filters deleted entries

## Technical Highlights

### Clean Architecture Maintained
- All use cases in Domain layer with no UI dependencies
- Repository protocol extended without breaking existing code
- ViewModels properly orchestrate between UI and use cases
- Infrastructure layer handles Core Data implementation details

### Error Handling
- Edit mode validates empty content before saving
- Delete operation uses soft delete for data recovery
- Proper error propagation through layers

### Performance
- Edit and delete operations are efficient
- No performance regression with large numbers of entries
- Core Data queries optimized with proper predicates

## QA Verification Checklist

## Next Steps
