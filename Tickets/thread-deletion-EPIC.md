# Thread Deletion EPIC

## Overview
This epic covers the implementation of thread deletion functionality with soft delete support, allowing users to delete threads while maintaining data integrity and providing recovery options.

## Design Reference
`/Design/delete-thread-mockup.html` - Interactive mockup showing:
- Ellipsis menu on thread list items
- Context menu with single "Delete Thread" option  
- Confirmation dialog with thread name and entry count
- Thread removal from list after deletion

## Technical Architecture
Following Clean Architecture principles from the TIP:
- **Context**: Journaling Context
- **Layers**: Changes span all four layers (domain, application, interface, infrastructure)
- **Pattern**: Soft delete with preserved data for future recovery

## TICKETS

### thread-deletion-TICKET-001: Thread Entity Soft Delete Support
**Story ID**: thread-deletion-TICKET-001  
**Context/Layer**: Journaling / domain  
**As a** developer  
**I want** Thread entity to support soft delete functionality  
**So that** threads can be safely deleted with recovery options  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given the existing Thread entity in Domain layer
- When I update `Domain/Entities/Thread.swift`
- Then Thread has optional `deletedAt: Date?` property
- And computed property `isDeleted: Bool { deletedAt != nil }` exists
- And helper method `entryCount: Int` returns count of entries
- And entity remains Codable for future export functionality
- [Arch-Lint] Entity follows TIP section 5.1.1 (Core Entities)
- [Coverage] 100% unit test coverage for new properties
- [Doc] Soft delete pattern documented in entity

**Implementation Guide**:
```swift
// Thread.swift additions
struct Thread: Identifiable, Codable {
    // Existing properties...
    let deletedAt: Date?
    
    var isDeleted: Bool {
        deletedAt != nil
    }
    
    var entryCount: Int {
        entries.filter { !$0.isDeleted }.count
    }
}
```

**QA Test Criteria**:
1. Test deletedAt property serialization/deserialization
2. Test isDeleted returns true when deletedAt is set
3. Test isDeleted returns false when deletedAt is nil
4. Test entryCount excludes soft-deleted entries
5. Verify Codable conformance with new property

**Priority Score**: 8 (WSJF) - Foundation for all deletion features  
**Dependencies**: None

### thread-deletion-TICKET-002: Delete Thread Use Case
**Story ID**: thread-deletion-TICKET-002  
**Context/Layer**: Journaling / domain  
**As a** developer  
**I want** DeleteThreadUseCase to handle thread deletion business logic  
**So that** threads can be soft deleted with proper cascade behavior  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given thread entity with soft delete support from TICKET-001
- When I create `Domain/UseCases/DeleteThreadUseCase.swift`
- Then protocol has single `execute(threadId: UUID) async throws` method
- And implementation sets deletedAt timestamp on thread
- And all associated entries are cascade soft deleted
- And ThreadNotFoundError thrown for invalid thread ID
- [Arch-Lint] Single execute method per TIP section 5.1.2 (Use Cases)
- [Coverage] 90%+ unit test coverage
- [Doc] Business rules for cascade deletion documented

**Implementation Guide**:
```swift
// DeleteThreadUseCase.swift
protocol DeleteThreadUseCase {
    func execute(threadId: UUID) async throws
}

final class DeleteThreadUseCaseImpl: DeleteThreadUseCase {
    private let repository: ThreadRepository
    
    func execute(threadId: UUID) async throws {
        // 1. Fetch thread or throw ThreadNotFoundError
        // 2. Set deletedAt = Date()
        // 3. Cascade delete all entries
        // 4. Call repository.softDelete(thread)
    }
}
```

**QA Test Criteria**:
1. Test valid thread ID results in soft delete
2. Test invalid thread ID throws ThreadNotFoundError
3. Test all entries in thread are cascade deleted
4. Test deletedAt timestamp is current time
5. Mock repository to verify softDelete called

**Priority Score**: 9 (WSJF) - Core deletion business logic

### thread-deletion-TICKET-003: Core Data Migration for Soft Delete
**Story ID**: thread-deletion-TICKET-003  
**Context/Layer**: Journaling / infrastructure  
**As a** developer  
**I want** Core Data migration to support soft delete fields  
**So that** thread deletion can be persisted with data recovery capability  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given existing Core Data model version 1.1
- When I create new model version 1.2
- Then CDThread entity has `deletedAt` attribute (type: Date, optional)
- And lightweight migration is configured properly
- And existing data is preserved after migration
- And migration succeeds with 100+ threads in < 2 seconds
- [Arch-Lint] Follows TIP section 5.4.1 (Core Data Implementation)
- [Coverage] Migration tested with edge cases
- [Doc] Migration steps documented

**Implementation Guide**:
```swift
// Core Data Model Changes
// 1. Select ThreadJournal2.xcdatamodeld
// 2. Editor > Add Model Version > Based on v1.1
// 3. Set v1.2 as current version
// 4. Add to CDThread:
//    - Attribute: deletedAt
//    - Type: Date
//    - Optional: YES
// 5. Enable lightweight migration in options
```

**QA Test Criteria**:
1. Test migration with empty database
2. Test migration with 100+ threads
3. Test existing data integrity preserved
4. Test new deletedAt field defaults to nil
5. Verify no data loss or corruption
6. Performance test: migration < 2s for 100 threads

**Priority Score**: 8 (WSJF) - Enables persistence layer  
**Dependencies**: None (can run parallel with domain tickets)

### thread-deletion-TICKET-004: Repository Soft Delete Implementation  
**Story ID**: thread-deletion-TICKET-004  
**Context/Layer**: Journaling / infrastructure  
**As a** developer  
**I want** ThreadRepository to support soft delete operations  
**So that** deleted threads are filtered from queries while remaining recoverable  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given Core Data migration from TICKET-003
- When I update `Domain/Repositories/ThreadRepository.swift` protocol
- Then protocol includes `softDelete(threadId: UUID) async throws` method
- And `Infrastructure/Repositories/CoreDataThreadRepository.swift` implements it
- And fetchAll excludes soft-deleted threads by default
- And `fetchAll(includeDeleted: Bool)` overload exists for recovery
- [Arch-Lint] Repository interface per TIP section 5.1.4
- [Coverage] 100% integration test coverage
- [Doc] Soft delete behavior documented

**Implementation Guide**:
```swift
// ThreadRepository protocol update
protocol ThreadRepository {
    func softDelete(threadId: UUID) async throws
    func fetchAll() async throws -> [Thread]
    func fetchAll(includeDeleted: Bool) async throws -> [Thread]
}

// CoreDataThreadRepository implementation
func fetchAll() async throws -> [Thread] {
    // NSPredicate: deletedAt == nil
    return try await fetchAll(includeDeleted: false)
}
```

**QA Test Criteria**:
1. Test softDelete sets deletedAt timestamp
2. Test fetchAll excludes deleted threads
3. Test fetchAll(includeDeleted: true) includes all
4. Test deleted threads remain in Core Data
5. Test concurrent delete operations
6. Verify predicate performance

- Then ViewModel has `@Published threadToDelete: Thread?`
- And `@Published showDeleteConfirmation: Bool` property exists
- And methods `confirmDelete()`, `deleteThread()`, `cancelDelete()` work
- And thread list refreshes after successful deletion
- [Arch-Lint] Follows MVVM per TIP section 5.2.1 (View Models)
- [Coverage] 90%+ unit test coverage
- [Doc] State transitions documented

**Implementation Guide**:
```swift
// ThreadListViewModel additions
@MainActor
final class ThreadListViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var threadToDelete: Thread?
    @Published var showDeleteConfirmation = false
    private let deleteThreadUseCase: DeleteThreadUseCase
    
    func confirmDelete(thread: Thread) {
        threadToDelete = thread
        showDeleteConfirmation = true
    }
    
    func deleteThread() async {
        guard let thread = threadToDelete else { return }
        // 1. Call deleteThreadUseCase.execute(thread.id)
        // 2. Handle errors with errorMessage
        // 3. Refresh thread list on success
        // 4. Reset deletion state
    }
}
```

**QA Test Criteria**:
1. Test confirmDelete sets state correctly
2. Test deleteThread calls use case with correct ID
