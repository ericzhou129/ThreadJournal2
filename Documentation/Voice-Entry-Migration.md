- **Feature discovery**: Voice entry appears automatically in compatible UI

### Feature Rollout

#### Immediate Availability
- **No setup required**: Voice entry works immediately after update
- **Permission-based**: Only requires microphone permission to use
- **Graceful degradation**: App functions normally if permission denied
- **Discovery mechanism**: Clear visual indicators for voice entry availability

#### User Onboarding
- **In-app introduction**: Brief tooltip or overlay on first launch after update
- **Permission flow**: Clear explanation when microphone permission requested
- **Feature tour**: Optional walkthrough of voice entry capabilities
- **Help integration**: Links to user guide from voice entry interface
