# Ticket Implementation Checklist

## Before Starting a Ticket

- [ ] Read ticket completely, including:
  - [ ] Story description
  - [ ] Layer designation (domain/application/interface/infrastructure)
  - [ ] Acceptance criteria (ALL items)
  - [ ] QA test criteria
  - [ ] Design references (if any)
  - [ ] Dependencies

- [ ] Verify understanding:
  - [ ] Can I explain what the user will see/do?
  - [ ] Do I know which files to modify/create?
  - [ ] Is this the right architectural layer?

## During Implementation

- [ ] Working in correct layer?
  - [ ] Domain ‚Üí `Domain/` directory only
  - [ ] Interface ‚Üí `Interface/` directory only
  - [ ] No cross-layer imports

- [ ] Meeting acceptance criteria?
  - [ ] Check off each criterion as completed
  - [ ] If unclear, ask for clarification
  - [ ] Don't mark complete if ANY criteria missing

## Before Committing

- [ ] Run all tests
- [ ] Test acceptance criteria manually
- [ ] Run QA test criteria
- [ ] Verify no architecture violations
- [ ] Check file/line length limits

## Commit Message

```

- No UI components added
- No button visibility logic
- Wrong architectural layer
```
